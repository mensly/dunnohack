# Dunno Hack

Play trivia by yourself or with friends using questions from [Open Trivia Database](https://opentdb.com).

This is an attempt to recreate a similar experience to games such as You Don't Know Jack.
The primary purpose is as a learning experience for creating this type of game, but it
should also be fun to play.
